# Web3 PayPal

This project represents a blockchain-based iteration of PayPal, which serves as a showcase of my proficiency in blockchain technology, smart contracts and DeFi. Through the implementation of a decentralized payment solution, the project enables the sending and receiving of transactions among users on-chain, while also featuring the ability to assign names to addresses and attach messages to facilitate more convenient payment management. Moreover, the system maintains a detailed transaction history, which is readily accessible through a user-friendly interface, ensuring that users can keep track of their transactional activities with ease.

## So far I've completed:

- The smart contract ([see file](contracts/PayPal.sol)). Please note: this is a work-in-progress contract that has not yet been gas optimised.

## What still needs to be completed:

- Backend script
- Frontend in React
